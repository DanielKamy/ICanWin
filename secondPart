Oh, 'cause I've been diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running, I keep running, I keep running
They say I may be making a mistake
I would've followed all the way, no matter how far
I know when you go down all your darkest roads
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard

Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard

Oh, it's funny how
The warning signs can feel like they're butterflies
Oh, 'cause I keep diggin' myself down deeper
I won't stop 'til I get where you are
I keep running when both my feet hurt
I won't stop 'til I get where you are

Oh, when you go down all your darkest roads
I would've followed all the way to the graveyard
